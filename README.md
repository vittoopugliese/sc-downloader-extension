SoundCloud Downloader is a simple extension that loads the track data and lets you download the current track with a single click.
You can visualize the track title, the uploader (click the uploader name or picture to go to the profile), the track image and the waveform (showing only for flexing ... )
Below the track data you have a button to download the track and you will have the track downloader, simple as that. Feel free to steal all the music you want!
This is the first version so UI might change later. Please if its not working for you feel free to open a PR or send me an email or a message.
